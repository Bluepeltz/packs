        "description": "Blue Archive is a role-playing game developed by Nexon Games, a subsidiary of Nexon. It was released in 2021 for Android and iOS, first in Japan by Yostar and worldwide later that year by Nexon. The game is free-to-play with gacha game mechanics as a means to obtain new characters.\n\nThe player and protagonist is a teacher who was summoned to the academy city of Kivotos by the president of the General Student Council, an extrajudicial committee governing the schools. Following her sudden disappearance, criminal activity rises around Kivotos, and the player is tasked by the remaining members of the council to resolve the issues and help search for the president.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
